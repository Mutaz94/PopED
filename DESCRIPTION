Description: Optimal experimental designs for both population and individual
    studies based on nonlinear mixed-effect models. Often this is based on a
    computation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). This package was developed
    for pharmacometric problems, and examples and predefined models are available
    for these types of systems.
